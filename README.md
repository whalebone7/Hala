# Hala
 This tool leverages the power of the `waybackurls` utility to fetch URLs associated with the target domain. It intelligently filters the fetched URLs using bash scripting techniques to avoid duplicates.

Next, `Hala` utilizes the `httpx` tool to determine if the obtained URLs are alive and accessible. This step ensures that only active paths are considered for further analysis, enhancing the efficiency of the process.

Once the live paths are identified, `Hala` proceeds to launch its parameter discovery mechanism. This comprehensive feature allows `Hala` to automatically search for and analyze various parameters present in the identified URLs.

# Tip

It's important to note that executing the HALA tool can be a time-consuming process. If you prefer to run it in the background of your machine and check the results later, you can use the following command: `nohup sh -c 'hala -u "target.com" -p "path/to/params.txt" ' &`.

This command runs the HALA tool within a `nohup` session, which allows it to continue running even after you log out or close the terminal. The output generated by HALA will be redirected to a file called `nohup.out`. You can check the contents of this file later to review the output.

To view the contents of `nohup.out`, you can use the `cat nohup.out` command. This will display the entire contents of the file. Alternatively, you can use `tail -f nohup.out` to continuously monitor the updates in real-time as the HALA tool progresses. This is particularly useful if you want to keep an eye on the ongoing process without manually refreshing the file.
